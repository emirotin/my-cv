# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I&apos;m Eugene, you have probably guessed that already.

I have been writing software for a while now, and for the last 12+ years it&apos;s been almost exclusively web applications, with JS (CoffeeScript, TypeScript) on both the server and the client side.

When I was starting, it was easy to capture my attention with some shiny new technology, elegant APIs, and the wet floor effect in the hero section. I was choosing the tools based on the hype, and I was looking for the next big thing. Since then, there were two projects that I was initially very skeptical about, but they turned out to be the best tools for the job. The first of themâ€”React. I was, like, where&apos;s my template language? Am I going to do the framework&apos;s job, and build the component tree myself? But after I have _actually_ used it, I got it. It was fast, and simple to reason about. Yet the escape hatches were there. It did the job. It is still doing, 6+ years later.

The second one is Tailwind ðŸ˜ƒ. I was so much against it. LONG class strings. MIXING concerns. This was not what I LEARNT. It was against my intuition. Until I actually _tried_ it. Well, it was less poetic than that. There were lots of overwhelmingly positive reviews on Twitter. I had to launch the new project, not solo, but with the team. Tailwind sounded like the right thing to do, despite my personal feelings. We used it. It worked great.

So, when I learnt that **Tailwind was hiring**, I was like, I have to apply. I have to work with the team that made me change my mind.

# Some anecdotes ðŸ«£

People like stories, I guess? Let me tell you some. It won't take too much of your time&hellip;

- Around 2010 I worked as a PM/EM with a small team working on a US-based construction industry document workflow startup. I was asked for an idea how an in-browser PDF annotation tool could be implemented, without paying the Adobe Acrobat PRO license. Instead, during the Christmas holidays I have built the fully working prototype. It was a fun project, and it was a success. The tool was used by the company for years, probably still in production. Oh, it supported IE6. ðŸ˜…
- In 2012â€“2014 I worked for a Russian startup providing the embedded &ldquo;Like&rdquo; button, with the micro-donation option. I had lots of fun implementing it with 3 iframes, and a master script to manage all the `postMessage`s. The twist? Our clients were oppositional media. We ended up not with a whimper, but with a bangâ€”unofficially blocked by the FSB. ðŸ¥²
- Between 2014 and 2017 I worked for the UK/US-based startup balena.io (IoT). When I went to represent them at a conference, I have built a robotic machine, and my colleague has donated a webcam that he has built. The conference organizers had to give me access to their private WiFi, because the public one was shit. I have demonstrated pushing over the air updates to both devices, real-time, and controlling the robot, while streaming it moving from the camera. ðŸ¤ª
- Around 2018 I worked for botpress.io, a Canadian startup for easy chatbots creation. There's cool story about how we brainstormed the necessity to keep the configuration in JSON files, while still tuning it at runtime, from the web UI. It's a long story, ask me about it when we have the in-person call. ðŸ˜œ
- In 2022 I was working with Cosuno, a German startup working in construction workflow automation (once again). I have noticed their servers were not using Brotli compression, only GZip. I wrote an RFC, figured out the Cloudflare changes (trivial) and Nginx (not so, had to build the module from sources), and in less than two weeks it went to production. It resulted in significant bandwidth savings, giving the fact GraphQL API was constantly queried. ðŸ’ª
