# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I&apos;m Eugene, you have probably guessed that already.

I have been writing software for a while now, and for the last 12+ years it&apos;s been almost exclusively web applications, with JS (CoffeeScript, TypeScript) on both the server and the client side.

When I was starting, it was easy to capture my attention with some shiny new technology, elegant APIs, and the wet floor effect in the hero section. I was choosing the tools based on the hype, and I was looking for the next big thing. Since then, there were two projects that I was initially very skeptical about, but they turned out to be the best tools for the job. The first of themâ€”React. I was, like, where&apos;s my template language? Am I going to do the framework&apos;s job, and build the component tree myself? But after I have _actually_ used it, I got it. It was fast, and simple to reason about. Yet the escape hatches were there. It did the job. It is still doing, 6+ years later.

The second one is Tailwind ðŸ˜ƒ. I was so much against it. LONG class strings. MIXING concerns. This was not what I LEARNT. It was against my intuition. Until I actually _tried_ it. Well, it was less poetic than that. There were lots of overwhelmingly positive reviews on Twitter. I had to launch the new project, not solo, but with the team. Tailwind sounded like the right thing to do, despite my personal feelings. We used it. It worked great.

So, when I learn that **Tailwind was hiring**, I was like, I have to apply. I have to work with the team that made me change my mind.
