  "readme": "mimosa-handlebars\n===========\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is a Handlebars compiler for the Mimosa build tool. This module is for use with Mimosa `2.0+`.  This replicates the functionality of Handlebars compiler that was built into Mimosa before `2.0`.\n\nThis module targets Handlebars without Ember. If you are using Handlebars with Ember, this will likely not work well for you. You probably want [mimosa-ember-handlebars](https://github.com/dbashford/mimosa-ember-handlebars).\n\nFor more information regarding Mimosa, see http://mimosa.io\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd `'handlebars'` to your list of modules.  That's all!  Mimosa will install the module for you when you start `mimosa watch` or `mimosa build`.\n\n## Functionality\n\nThis module will compile Handlebars files during `mimosa watch` and `mimosa build`.\n\nThis module utilizes all of the built-in template behavior that comes with Mimosa's basic template compiler.  See the [mimosa website](http://mimosa.io/compilers.html#mt) for more information about how templates are treated or check out the various [`template` configuration options](http://mimosa.io/configuration.html#templates).\n\n## Default Config\n\n```coffeescript\nhandlebars:\n  lib: undefined\n  extensions: [\"hbs\", \"handlebars\"]\n  helpers:[\"app/template/handlebars-helpers\"]\n```\n\n* `lib`: You may want to use this module but may not be ready to use the latest version of Handlebars. Using the `lib` property you can provide a specific version of Handlebars if the one being used by this module isn't to your liking. To provide a specific version, you must have it `npm install`ed into your project and then provide it to `lib`. For instance: `lib: require('handlebars')`.\n* `extensions`: an array of strings, the extensions of your Handlebars files.\n* `helpers`: an array of strings, the paths from `watch.javascriptDir` to the files containing handlebars helper/partial registrations",
